# Fitness Log and Gym Routine Manager
2021 DeltaHacks Entry

## About
This program allows users to track their workout progress and manage their favourite exercise routines. A user can create personalized workout splits with specific exercises, number of sets and number of reps.

## Technologies Used
- We used object-oriented programming from Python on the backend to manage the users, routines, and workout sessions that all interconnected. 
- Django was our desired framework for the front-end, but was not implemented due to reasons which are explained below

## Challenges
- Since our team had a lack of experience with front-end development, we took the challenge to learn a new framework in Django, but we were unable to leverage this tool due to a time crunch
- Going forward, we would love to take some more time to dive deeper into this framework and implement a web app user interface on the front-end of the project
